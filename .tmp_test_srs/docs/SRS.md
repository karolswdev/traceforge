# docloom - Software Requirements Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Baseline

## Introduction

This document outlines the software requirements for **docloom**. It serves as the single source of truth for what the system must do, the constraints under which it must operate, and the rules governing its development and deployment.

Each requirement has a **unique, stable ID** (e.g., `PROD-001`). These IDs **MUST** be used to link implementation stories and test cases back to these foundational requirements, ensuring complete traceability.

The requirement keywords (`MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `MAY`) are used as defined in RFC 2119.
